**NetSuite**

NetSuite developer with 4+ years of experience in a primarily development focussed role. Experienced with producing account customisations, larger SDF based projects, troubleshooting, and providing support. Comfortable with owning a piece of work from requirement gathering through to Production deployment.

 - SuiteScript 2.0/2.1 & SDF
 - Suitelet Applications (Custom and NetSuite UI)
 - Freemarker & Advanced PDF Layouts
 - Third-party system integrations
 - Script issues: diagnosis &rarr; resolution
 - Project ownership: requirements &rarr; specification &rarr; production

**Miscellaneous**

I have worked on some projects using languages/frameworks that I had no experience with, needing to learn the required skills whilst working on the projects. Using C#/.NET, I worked on a 2FA application for internal business use, and with Python I integrated a Django application with NetSuite for data synchronisation.

 - .NET: 2FA application for TOTP code genration
